# Verdant Signal — the game server. Browser code has no build step; the server installs its two adapters.
#
# The COPY list below is an ALLOWLIST, and that is the whole point of using a Dockerfile here rather than
# letting a builder guess. This image must never contain .env (api keys) or .supermemory/ (auth-secret plus
# personal memory documents) — both sit in the project root, and an over-broad CLI deploy once put that pair
# on a public URL where `GET /.supermemory/api-key` answered 200. A committed, reviewable COPY list is a
# boundary that survives someone forgetting to update an ignore file. .dockerignore denies everything by
# default as the second layer, and server.mjs refuses dotfile paths as the third.
#
# SECRETS come from the host's environment variables (Railway's dashboard), never from a copied .env.
# server.mjs only reads .env for values NOT already in process.env, so real env vars win and no .env
# needs to ship.
#
# assets/ IS copied, and where it comes from is the whole trick. A public repo of raw CraftPix art is the
# one thing the licence forbids; shipping that art inside a deployed game is expressly allowed. So the art
# licensed packs stay outside this public repository. Original `assets/verdant-signal/` art is tracked publicly.
# Only .png is ever loaded (50 references, all .png), and the deploy repo carries only the 324 files a
# recorded boot proved the game requests (6.9MB) — not all 2034 PNGs (27MB), and none of the 146MB of
# .psd/.aseprite source art.
#
# A new original sprite must be added to `assets/verdant-signal/` and committed with its code reference.
# Without the art the game still runs on pixel.js's procedural sprites — but wilderness ROCKS have no
# fallback at all and render as nothing while staying impassable and still being the ore source, so an
# art-less deploy is a broken-looking world, not a plainer one.
