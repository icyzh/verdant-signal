// save.js — Verdant Signal persistence (#88): IndexedDB storage for colony snapshots.
//
// A town whose whole thesis is "little people who remember" must not forget itself on
// reload — so the lived world (chronicle, bonds, grudges, monuments, the charted map,
// every farmer's journal) survives across sessions. The sim side lives in farm.js
// (World.serialize / World.fromSave); this module is only the browser storage glue.
//
// Slots: one snapshot per world seed under 'town:<seed>', plus a 'latest' pointer so a
// plain visit resumes the last-played town. Everything here is best-effort: a storage
// failure must NEVER take down the game — worst case the town simply starts fresh.

// user engagement, a town can vanish through no action of the player's. A granted persist() makes the origin
// exempt on Chromium and counts as an engagement signal elsewhere. Best-effort and fire-and-forget: the
// answer changes nothing about how we save, so nothing waits on it and a refusal is not an error.

// THE SLOT INVARIANT (Codex #58 stated it; everything here enforces it)
//
// A town snapshot lives in a SLOT keyed by seed. Two values identify a slot version:
//   generation (`gen:<seed>`) — the OCCUPANT's identity. Incremented whenever the slot changes hands, i.e.
//       whatever is in it is no longer a continuation of what was there (quarantine, restore, wipe, undo).
//       Lives on the slot, not in the snapshot: a reader learns it when it reads.
//   `_rev` — the ORDER of continuations of that one occupant. Lives in the snapshot.
//
// Together they are ONE compare-and-set token, and a live writer owns the pair it observed atomically. A save
// commits only when its pair EXACTLY matches the stored pair — equality, not `>=`. Being behind is a stale
// tab; being ahead is not a benign case but evidence of inconsistent provenance, and authorizing it fails
// open on exactly the corruption the check exists to catch. Committing preserves the generation and advances
// the revision by one. Claiming an EMPTY slot is its own transition: no bump, and only a rev-0 writer — one
// that actually observed the slot empty at this generation — may do it.

// A snapshot this build cannot hydrate is MOVED ASIDE, never overwritten. Two reasons, and the second one
// is subtler than it looks:
//
//  1. It may still be readable. A save from a newer build, or one that trips a bug this build has and the
//     next one fixes, is not garbage — it is the player's town. The old boot path logged a console warning
//     and founded a fresh town on the same seed, so the first autosave buried a town someone had played for
//     days. Keeping it costs a few hundred KB and is the difference between "we'll fix it" and "it's gone".
//
//  2. It unblocks saving. `saveTown` is a compare-and-set against the STORED snapshot's `_rev`, and it is
//     right to refuse a write from behind it — that guard is what stops a stale tab clobbering a newer town.
//     But a freshly founded world has no rev, so founding over a rev-47 snapshot meant every autosave for
//     the rest of the session was refused with only a console warning: the player was dropped into day 1 AND
//     could not save. Vacating the slot fixes that without weakening the CAS.
//
// One quarantine per seed, overwritten if it happens again (same one-deep discipline as the wipe backup).
//
// Codex #56-1 — VACATING A SLOT RESETS THE REVISION EPOCH, and `_rev` alone cannot detect that. saveTown
// refuses a write only when the STORED rev is AHEAD of the writer's, which is sound while revs climb
// monotonically in one slot. Quarantine breaks that assumption: the slot restarts at rev 0, so a tab still
// holding the quarantined town at rev 47 sails through the check (1 > 47 is false), overwrites the
// replacement town, resurrects the old snapshot at rev 48 — and every save from the new session is refused
// from then on. Exactly the state quarantine existed to prevent.
//
// Revs cannot distinguish the two generations, because both count in the same sequence. So the slot carries a
// durable GENERATION counter, bumped every time the slot's identity changes under it (quarantine, restore).
// It belongs to the SLOT, not to the snapshot: a reader learns the live generation when it loads, so nothing
// needs to be written into the save and SAVE_VERSION does not move. A writer whose generation is behind the
// stored one is from a superseded epoch and is refused no matter what its rev says.
const genKey = seed => 'gen:' + String(seed);
// Codex #58 item 5 — `readGen`, `registerTownInWorld` and `saveWorldIndex` were REMOVED, not merely left
// unused. Each was a superseded shape: a bare generation read (the #57-1 bug), an index upsert with no
// generation fence, and a whole-index overwrite with no fence at all. Leaving them exported is how the unsafe
// pattern comes back — the same reasoning that deleted `loadTown`. Use `loadTownState` for a paired
// observation and `updateWorldIndex` for an atomic index mutation.



// Codex #58 — an AUTOMATIC discontinuity must CAS its target. This is not an explicit destructive command
// like a wipe (where targeting "whatever occupies the slot" is the user's intent); it is triggered BY a
// specific snapshot failing to hydrate, so it must move that snapshot and no other. Without the check the
// sequence is: loadTownState observes A -> hydration of A fails -> another tab saves B -> quarantineTown reads
// whatever is present and files B away under A's failure reason. B was fine; it is now in the unreadable pile
// and its player is on a fresh town. `expect` is the { gen, rev } pair the caller observed; a mismatch aborts
// and reports `stale`, and the caller must re-observe rather than proceed.
//
// Returns { ok, rec, gen, stale }:
//   ok   — did the move actually commit? Codex #56-2: a storage failure used to be flattened to null, which
//          the caller could not tell apart from "there was nothing to move" — so boot carried on over a
//          snapshot that was STILL THERE, and the rev guard refused every save for the session. The caller
//          must be able to distinguish, and must not persist over a save it failed to preserve.
//   rec  — the preserved record, or null when the slot was already empty (which is a success, not a failure).

// Codex r20 P1: ATOMIC read-modify-write of the world index in a SINGLE IndexedDB transaction. The old flow
// (loadWorldIndex -> mutate in memory -> saveWorldIndex) was a racy read-modify-write across separate txns —
// two open tabs registering different towns could each read the same index and clobber the other's summary /
// encounter / ledger / inbox. IndexedDB serializes readwrite transactions on a store, so doing the get + mutate
// + put inside ONE txn makes concurrent updates safe (each sees the prior's committed value). `mutator(cur)`
// mutates + returns the index; it must be SYNCHRONOUS (no awaits — the txn would auto-close). Returns the
// stored index, or null on failure (best-effort, never throws into the sim).
//
// Codex #58 — `fence` extends the SLOT INVARIANT to derived state. Any mutation carrying data derived from a
// slot's occupant (a town summary, encounters resolved from it, its inbox) must only land while that occupant
// is still the authoritative one. Pass `{ seed, gen }`; the generation is read in THIS transaction and the
// mutator is skipped entirely on a mismatch (returns null, which every caller already treats as "did not
// happen").
//
// Why the index needed this at all: it has its own rev-monotonic guard, so it inherited the whole #56-1 bug.
// After a quarantine the entry kept the SUPERSEDED town's revision and silently rejected the replacement's
// summaries — reproduced on seed 313131, live world at rev 2 while the index still read rev 8, leaving a ghost
// of a dead town on the world map. And per the review, generation-in-the-summary alone is not enough: a
// DELAYED generation-0 write can still land after the quarantine if the old entry was pruned, which is why the
// fence is checked against the authoritative `gen:<seed>` here rather than against whatever the index holds.
