// speech-anim.js — how a farmer's spoken line ARRIVES on screen.
//
// Pulled out of main.js's #bubble-typewriter into its own module for one reason: the comparison
// harness (`speech_anim_compare.html`) imports THIS file, so what you judge side-by-side is
// literally what the game runs. A harness that reimplements the effect drifts from the game within
// a week and then lies to you.
//
// THE PROBLEM. The shipped reveal types left-to-right, one letter at a time. The reader's eye
// finishes at the right edge and has to snap back across the full plate for every new line — a
// full-width return sweep, several times per saying. A centre-out reveal grows from the middle, so
// the eye stays near the centre and the return distance is roughly halved.
//
// DECIDED (owner, 2026-08-06, from the harness): **word-center** — per word, grown outward from the
// centre. Both changes together. The two variables were rendered separately (granularity: letter vs
// word; anchor: left vs centre) because the proposal changes both at once and it was worth knowing
// which one was doing the work. Both were.
//
// FOLLOW-UP (same session): word-center read "a little staccato". TWO separate causes, and they are
// worth naming because only one of them is the obvious one:
//   1. ALPHA POP — each word appears at full opacity in a single frame.
//   2. THE CENTRING JUMP — the non-obvious one. On a centre-out reveal, every new word shifts ALL
//      the previously-revealed words leftward by half its width. That is a hard positional jump of
//      the entire line on every word, and it is plausibly the larger contributor.
// `fade` softens (1) and `glide` softens (2); they are independent so the harness can attribute the
// improvement rather than guess.

import { textWidth, normText } from './pixel.js';

// CANONICALIZE AT THE DOOR (Codex #128, both P3s). Two contract gaps shared one root: this module
// parsed words and placed segments on the RAW string while drawText/textWidth operate on the
// NORMALIZED one. (1) A mid-line length-changing glyph — 'A… B', 'A↔B C' — desynced segment x
// offsets from the drawn glyph advances. (2) Surrounding whitespace broke the contract outright:
// 'Rain. ' could never reach done (last word ends before line.length) and ' A B' delayed word 1
// past t=0. So every public function folds + trims its line FIRST: after canon, every character
// is exactly one glyph, offsets*4 are true pixel advances, and the ends/length arithmetic closes.
// Idempotent (canon(canon(x)) === canon(x)), so callers passing pre-normalized text lose nothing.
// Production (wrapWords) never emits these shapes today — this is the module honoring its own
// exported contract, not a live-bug fix.

// ~28 characters is cut off before it finishes. Fitting prevents that: the reveal takes its natural
// pace when that fits inside the budget and compresses when it does not, so every word always
// arrives, reaches full opacity, and the finished line dwells.
//
// HONEST SCOPE (corrected after Codex #98 P2-4). This was discovered in the harness using synthetic
// UNWRAPPED lines, and was written up at the time as a defect that had been shipping for months.
// That was wrong: `say()` wraps every bubble line to SAY_LINE_CHARS (18) before the renderer ever
// sees it, and 18 * 0.03 = 0.54s fits comfortably inside 0.85s. **No production line has ever been
// truncated.** The fitting stays because it makes the module correct for any caller and costs
// nothing, but it should not be described as having rescued anything.
//
// In practice the cap (lineSec * REVEAL_FRAC = 0.51s) binds slightly on the longest wrapped lines —
// a full 18-char line reveals in 0.51s rather than 0.54s. That is the entire live effect.

// WORD ARRIVALS FOLLOW THE TYPEWRITER (owner, 2026-08-14). The old cadence divided the reveal
// budget by (n-1) so the LAST word landed exactly at revealDuration — an elegant invariant with a
// degenerate case that shipped: on a TWO-WORD line the entire budget became ONE pause. "DRIVING"
// sat alone for the full 0.51s before "SUNFLOWER" arrived, and the owner read it as a finished
// line followed by a repeat. The old letter baseline never had this: its timing was CONTINUOUS,
// proportional to the text.
//
// So word k now arrives when the letter reveal would REACH its first character:
//     arrival(k) = ws[k].start * (revealDuration / line.length)
// Word 1 is on screen at t=0; gaps are proportional to the preceding word's length (the letter
// contract, chunked); a two-word line's pause is ~0.24s, not the whole window; and the last word
