// tests/ablation.mjs — #1.3 the ABLATION PROOF: memory is load-bearing, not decorative.
//
// The council's honesty challenge: does the CockroachDB integration actually EARN it, or would any random
// seed grow the same town? This harness answers by founding three towns from the SAME world seed but DIFFERENT
// memory sources — real corpus, the same corpus SHUFFLED (so each founder gets a different source doc), and the
// invented fallback crew — then ticking each 30 days and showing they diverge OBSERVABLY (different archetype
// mix, different creeds, different lived outcomes), not merely in a label. Same seed, different memories =>
// a different society. It is also a determinism check: each source self-compares byte-identical run-to-run.
//
// Run: `node tests/ablation.mjs`  (exits non-zero if a town is nondeterministic, or if the three fail to diverge)
