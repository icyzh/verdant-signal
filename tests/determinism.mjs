// DOCTRINE: the SIM consumes only seeded rng (world.rand, per-farmer this.rand) + pure position hashes with
// stable, sorted iteration. Same seed => byte-identical town, twice. The LLM + CockroachDB are display/
// persistence side-channels the sim never reads in its loop (compile-don't-query), so this harness runs the
// sim headless with both OFF — which is exactly the deterministic core the doctrine describes.
//
// Run: `node tests/determinism.mjs`  (exits non-zero if any seed fails to self-compare)
//
// It boots the founder cast the way the game does (generateCrew -> addFarmer -> ensureFounderVariety), ticks
// N days, and hashes farmer + world state across TWO runs of the same seed. A same-seed run that differs
// run-to-run is a P0 determinism bug. The BASELINE hashes below fingerprint the current tree; a legitimate
// sim-affecting change re-baselines them (update the constant), but same-twice must ALWAYS hold.

    // re-baselined 2026-07-14 for two behavioural fixes: (1) a fleeing farmer now bolts for the PLAZA when their
    // own fence isn't up (an open plot is no refuge — the threat just follows them in) instead of a false-safe
    // homestead; (2) the ACTION_ENERGY falsy-0 bug fixed (`?? 0.05`, not `|| 0.05`) so plant/harvest/clear are
    // truly FREE and tilling is a light 0.017 (was silently 0.05) — which shifts every farming day's energy curve.
    // same-twice held all seeds (fully reproducible; only the fingerprint moved).
    // re-baselined 2026-07-15 — FOE-vs-FENCE: a foe (orc/assassin) no longer breaks off when a farmer reaches
    // their fenced plot — it presses in and BASHES the fence down (property destruction), and a farmer flees for
    // help at the plaza rather than a false-safe fence (a wary one straight away, a naive one once it's breached).
    // Real behavioural changes to the encounter/flee loop; same-twice held all seeds.
    // re-baselined 2026-07-15 for Codex #31 P1 — a raider-BREACHED fence is now REPAIRED by its owner at any house
    // level (was stranded for housed plots), and #foeBashFence no longer nulls an in-progress upgrade — both shift
    // the day-2+ trajectory whenever a foe bashes a fence in the run. same-twice held all seeds.
    // re-baselined 2026-07-15 for the WATCH/FOE-CADENCE batch (all seeded, same-twice held): (1) lethal foes
    // (orc/assassin) are now gated behind their own long #foeCooldown so raids are rare + well-spaced (beasts still
    // wander in on the ordinary interval) — shifts the encounter timeline; (2) the day's SENTRY stands at arms —
    // charges to defend a townsfolk under attack (joins as a helper → changes clash resolution) instead of only
    // sounding the alarm; (3) a fleeing farmer runs TO the fit sentry (the guard is the refuge), and a sentry who's
    // the quarry never counts home safe; (4) a sick/felled watcher HANDS OFF to the founders' rotation (currentSentry
    // now skips the unfit), so the beat is never dark; (5) "no one came" excludes the on-duty sentry from the
    // resented bystanders (changes adjustOpinion/remember). All five touch day-2+ sim state → the fingerprint moves.
    // (foe kind-roll rebalanced same batch: assassin is now the RARE stalker (r<0.20, standout only), orc the usual
    // raider (r<0.65) — the fingerprint moved again; same-twice held.)
    // re-baselined 2026-07-15 for Codex #32 P1 (the sentry could not actually FIGHT while the quarry fled) — TWO
    // coupled fixes: (a) #resolveClash lets adjacent HELPERS swing even when the target flees (was a lone dodge +
    // early return); (b) the encounter now brings the foe to BAY — a standing defender within the <2.2 swing radius
    // HALTS the foe's chase and forces the clash (before, the foe only clashed when it caught the fleeing TARGET,
    // which at matched speed it rarely did, so an intercepting guard was inert). Together: a defended fleeing farmer's
    // foe now takes damage / is driven off. Verified: foe HP 4→1 while the quarry fled + the sentry fought. same-twice
    // held; the day-2+ trajectory shifts wherever a guard engages a foe in the run.
    // re-baselined 2026-07-15 — SLEEP-OUT SICKNESS reworked: (1) the on-duty SENTRY is exempt from the dawn illness
    // roll (standing watch = not sleeping is their duty — `stoodWatch` flag); (2) a single CALM rough night never
    // rolls — illness needs a STREAK (`roughStreak>=2`), roofless exposure past the grace, or a rough night in
    // inclement weather (storm/blizzard), always a CON save whose DC scales with the streak/exposure/weather. New
    // serialized farmer fields `roughStreak`/`nightsExposed`. Changes the day-2+ dawn-check trajectory; same-twice held.
    // re-pinned 2026-07-17d: #silo (towns start at level 0, cheap L0->L1) shifts town-XP timing. Prior: #crit (foe critical hits in wilderness clashes — a nat-20 double blow)
    // shifts the encounter trajectory. Prior: #health wound-recovery (Healer binds wounds incl. the sentry at post;
    // self-salve mends hp; red-health farmers don't hunt into danger; sentry stands down when critically
    // hurt) legitimately shifts the trajectory. Prior: #farmyard (facilities cluster at the house, crops buffered a tile
    // off every pen, yardV save marker) legitimately shifts placement + the serialized shape
    // re-pinned 2026-07-18 — P2.5 SEARCH PARTY + Codex #43 hardening. The search party is a REAL new behavior that
    // FIRES in normal 30-day play (a farmer downed far in the wilds is rescued: riders muster + think() + march),
    // legitimately shifting the trajectory. Codex #43 fixes compound it: off-field (onSortie) riders are now excluded
    // from civic selection/quorum/voting (#civicPresent), their wilderness encounters are DETACHED at departure (an
    // off-field target no longer draws world.rand), and departure revalidates riders. All same-twice held.
    // re-pinned 2026-07-28 — #paddock. Facilities are no longer squeezed into the homestead: each coop, pen,
    // fold, pond, mill and hatch house is raised in its own fenced enclosure ANNEXED OUTSIDE the existing fence
    // line, sited by direction and cleared of trees first, with the building centred on a real tile footprint
    // rather than pinned to one corner tile. That changes where ground gets claimed, what it costs in fence
    // wood, when the frontier and the cropland cap read as full, and the serialized plot shape (new padCells).
    // Every seed still held same-twice=true — the invariant is intact; only the fingerprint moved. Seed
    // 20260706 is unchanged (no farm reaches a facility inside the 30-day window).
    // Amended same day — paddocks now land on a LATTICE anchored to one side of the property line (fill a
    // lane, then the next lane out) instead of being scored one at a time, with kin facilities preferring
    // adjacent slots, and grazing livestock ambling across their pens rather than holding one spot. Only
    // seed 7 moved again; same-twice held throughout.
    // Amended again — PADDOCK_CELL 7 -> 9 (livestock pens needed real grazing room; the cell stays uniform
    // so the lattice keeps tiling), buildings anchored on their FOOTPRINT centre rather than the paddock's
    // so sprite and collision agree, stock turned out into the yard IN FRONT of the building instead of
    // the paddock centre, and an asymmetric containment inset scaled by build. All placement + producer
    // trajectories, so every seed but 20260706 re-fingerprints; same-twice held on all four.
    // re-pinned 2026-07-28 for the Codex #45 fixes, all of them sim-affecting: a facility's fence and
    // building are now quoted and paid as ONE bill (a farmer holding just the fence cost could build and
    // finish in debt), the paddock lattice anchors on the house-CONNECTED yard rather than all cropland
    // (a detached frontier field dragged the anchor off into open country), the lattice commits only once
    // ground has changed hands rather than at plan time, the kin weight is derived so it actually dominates
    // position + timber, and the house-upgrade acreage gate measures cropland to match its own cap.
    // same-twice held on all four seeds; 20260706 unchanged (no farm reaches a facility inside 30 days).
    // re-pinned 2026-07-29 — MOVEMENT, so this one moves every seed including 20260706, which had held
    // through the whole paddock series (that work only ever touched facilities, and no farm reaches one
    // inside 30 days; fleeing and fighting happen in every run). Two fixes, both the same shape: a fleeing
    // farmer's VEER around an obstacle was applied without checking where it landed, so a panic run could
    // sidestep into a pond; and closing to FIGHT walked to the foe's tile, which findPath permits as the
    // goal, so a foe standing in water was waded out to. Approaches now route through one #standNear
    // helper — the guard existed inline for producer work and had already been missed once for poaching
    // and twice more for fighting. same-twice held on all four seeds.
    // re-pinned again 2026-07-29 — the same movement class, found by review #50. SIX more approaches were
    // still walking to a live entity's tile + 0.5 without checking it (teaching, wound care, the herb run,
    // both barter paths, visiting), so a neighbour standing on a pond bank could produce a water goal that
    // findPath admits. And the flee veer, having been given a check last commit, tested only ONE
    // perpendicular: a farmer cornered where the forward step and that veer were both blocked stood
    // motionless for the whole 0.5s fleeTimer with the open direction untried — measured at 16 consecutive
    // frozen ticks before the fix, 1 after. Both are movement, so all four seeds move again. same-twice held.
    // 20260706 alone moved 2026-07-29: the SABOTAGE approach now stands outside the victim's house rather
    // than walking into it, and only that seed runs a sabotage inside 30 days. The workstation fix (millers
    // were targeting a tile inside their own 3x3 footprint) doesn't show here — no farm reaches a mill in
    // 30 days, which is exactly the blind spot tests/paddock.mjs exists to cover.
    // re-pinned 2026-07-29 — CREATURE MOVEMENT, the upstream half of the walk-on-water class. Prey and
    // foes wrote their positions unconditionally, so a deer grazed across ponds and a wolf chased through
    // barns; and a foe standing in water is what made an unguarded farmer approach reachable at all. Both
    // now move through World#creatureStep (heading, then either perpendicular, then stay put), and an
    // encounter that would spawn on blocked ground is relocated to the nearest open tile. Every run has
    // prey and encounters, so all four seeds move. Combat verified unweakened across four towns: 89 vs 90
    // encounters, 1309 vs 1130 damage dealt. same-twice held.
    // re-pinned 2026-07-29 for the Codex #52 fixes. Only 42 and 3 move: the fence-aware foe/beast stepping
    // (a perpendicular veer could carry a foe INTO an intact fenced plot without bashing it) and the swept
    // step (endpoint-only collision let a 2.5-tile hunt burst tunnel clean through a blocked tile) both
    // need the right geometry to bite, and only those two seeds hit it inside 30 days. The project-frontage
    // guard, the merchant target and the underfoot-terrain escape move nothing here. same-twice held.
    // re-pinned 2026-07-31 for the #rest-hold fix: a roofless farmer's NIGHT rest now holds until dawn (or
    // until the sleep urge clears / watch duty calls) instead of exiting the tick energy crosses 0.5 — which
    // had #decide re-resting them EVERY TICK all night (a rest<->decide flip-flop: bubble stuck at "EN|",
    // sprite twitching; the sibling of the V2 sleep<->walk flicker). Behavioural: early roofless nights now
    // hold rest through the night, so every seed's day-2+ energy/chore trajectory moves. Measured: worst
    // per-farmer rest-exit count over 3 days fell 822 -> 11. same-twice held all seeds.
    // re-pinned 2026-07-31 for #chop-side: a walk whose purpose is working a tree/stump/rock now pre-picks
    // its stand tile (camera-facing south faces first, nearer-first, then the north pair; deterministic
    // geometry + own position) instead of stopping ON the walkable trunk tile or wherever findPath's route
    // arrived — measured 129/129 chop stands on the camera-facing side (was 0, all ON the trunk). Every
    // wood/ore trip's end tile moves, so all four seeds drift. same-twice held all seeds.
    // re-pinned 2026-08-03 for #vote-sacred + #vote-postpone (owner-directed): (1) the day-10 sentry now
    // stands down and ATTENDS the founding gathering (every seed's sentry path + post-vote trajectory
    // moves — hence all four drift); (2) the raid telegraph pauses and lethal foes can't spawn during the
    // vote ceremony (deferred raids land after the ballot); (3) a town with fewer than half its souls able
    // postpones the vote to the next dawn (no baseline town hits this — verified separately on a forged
    // 5-sick town: waits day 10, founds day 12). same-twice held all seeds.
    // re-pinned 2026-08-03 (2) for #delib-variety: the assemble-mutter beat slowed 3-8s -> 9-17s (same
    // single rand draw per beat, but FEWER beats fire across the day-10 gathering, so each seed's draw
    // stream shifts from the vote day onward). Display cadence change; all four seeds drift, same-twice
    // held. The other overlap/variety fixes (pending-say ceremony gate, walk-in pool, chat silence) are
    // bubble-display only and move nothing on their own.
