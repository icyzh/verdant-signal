// memory-backfill.js — seed the browser memory store from towns that ALREADY EXIST (#memory-backfill).
//
// The store shipped empty for everyone: the write-back only compiles the ACTIVE town going forward,
// behind a maturity throttle — so players with living worlds saw "no memories" despite their saves
// holding exactly the data the memory promises (owner: "at least there is some data that supports
// what already exists"). This module walks the world index once per boot and, for any saved town not
// yet CLAIMED, hydrates the save through the standard World.fromSave and compiles it through the
// SAME builders the live writers use (lifeOf / townHistoryOf / inventionsOf) — one life shape, one
// code path, zero drift.
//
// Deliberate choices:
//   - The maturity throttle is SKIPPED here: a farmer's name, archetype, and founding creeds are a
//     real identity worth representing (the local store is free; the throttle guards paid ingest).
//   - LOCAL ONLY — no server echo. Backfilling a dozen town histories into a self-hosted
//     CockroachDB's extraction pipeline in one burst is exactly what the live cadence exists to
//     avoid; matured lives still echo through the normal writers.
//   - ATOMIC CLAIMS (Codex #92 P1): a COMPLETION MARKER lands only after every required payload
//     succeeded. A mid-batch storage failure leaves no marker; the next boot retries the whole
//     town — already-landed rows fill in by upsert, so a town can never be permanently partial.
//   - ATTEMPT-BASED BUDGET + ROTATION (Codex #92 P2): hydration attempts (not successes) consume
//     the per-boot bound, and the candidate order rotates per boot, so corrupt snapshots can
//     neither blow the budget nor permanently starve the towns behind them.
//   - The ACTIVE-town completion pass runs INDEPENDENTLY of the index (Codex #92 P2): a brand-new
//     town before its first autosave still gets its farmers represented. It fills only MISSING
//     life docs — the live cadence's fresher copies are never overwritten — and leaves history/
//     inventions to the live writers, which compile them fresher than any save could.
//   - Battles cannot be backfilled — they are display-derived records that were never saved; the
//     war record accrues from the moment the store shipped.
//
// Off-sim, boot-idle, display/persistence only — determinism untouched by construction.
