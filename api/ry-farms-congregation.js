// and share a watch so none stands alone. DISPLAY TEXT ONLY: the sim never reads these lines (the words go into
// transient speech bubbles), so the seeded world stays byte-identical whether or not the model ever answers.
// Any failure returns { fallback: true } and the client's authored offline pools carry the scene instead.

// Same serverless shape as ry-farms-conscience.js / ry-farms-dm.js (mounted by server.mjs).
