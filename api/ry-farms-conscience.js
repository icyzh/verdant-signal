// api/ry-farms-conscience.js — the CONSCIENCE channel (#93): the player as a stray inner

//
//   { stage: 'classify', ... } -> maps the player's free-text whisper onto ONE bounded urge
//        kind (+ optional target name + tone). This is what the sim "hears": the same reading
//        the narrator will answer, so there's no keyword-vs-reply desync. The DETERMINISTIC
//        verdict (heed / already / bargain / dismiss / question / defy) is decided sim-side in
//        farm.js from this kind — the model never rolls the outcome.
//
//   { stage: 'reply', ... } -> writes the farmer's in-character response GIVEN the verdict the
//        sim already decided. Display text only; it can never change what the farmer will do.
//
// Same serverless shape as ry-farms-chat.js / ry-farms-dm.js (mounted by server.mjs). Every
// failure returns { fallback: true } so the client's offline keyword+template path stands in,
// and the game — and its determinism — is unaffected whether or not the voice is ever answered.
