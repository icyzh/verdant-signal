// tools/probe-endpoints.mjs — run EVERY production LLM shape against a candidate model.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. tools/probe-llm.mjs reconstructs requests, and a reconstruction is a guess: it
// measured a 300-character prompt where production sends 1,947, and a `number` seed where production
// sends `integer`. Codex #106 P1-1 then pointed out the deeper problem — only 4 of the 9 production
// callLLM shapes were covered at all, so a model could pass the matrix and still fail the deployed
// workload. Which is exactly what happened on 2026-08-06, when gpt-oss-20b passed classification and
// silently broke replies and congregation scenes for live visitors.
//
// So this does not rebuild anything. It calls the REAL handlers with realistic bodies, which means
// the real prompt, the real schema, the real token budget, and the whole _llm.js path underneath —
// model chain, reasoning_effort, format fallback, breaker. It cannot drift from production because
// it IS production; the only fabricated part is the request body a browser would have sent.
//
// The shape most at risk is the one with the LEAST room: the raid duel beat runs on 120 tokens, and
// the failure that broke production was reasoning tokens eating the budget before any content came
// out. That call fires mid-raid, in the most dramatic moment the game has, and until now nobody had
// ever measured it.
//
// USAGE (key in .env, or inline):
//   node tools/probe-endpoints.mjs
//   node tools/probe-endpoints.mjs --models openai/gpt-oss-120b,openai/gpt-oss-20b
//   node tools/probe-endpoints.mjs --only duel --verbose
//
// Real, billable calls. Paced by --delay (default 8s) because the free tier meters tokens per
// MINUTE and a burst starves its own later rows — that mistake made a whole earlier matrix unreadable.
