// world stays deterministic whether or not the chronicler ever answers. Enriched tales
// are stamped story.llm = true and live on the sheet, so the existing save carries them;
// a farmer is asked about exactly once per town, ever. Offline / no key / bad response —
// any failure at all — simply leaves the stage-1 procedural tale standing.

// #dm-batch1 — enrich ONE farmer per pass, not the whole cast at once.
//
// The old shape asked for every un-enriched founder in a single request, and that was wrong in
// three ways at the same time (Codex #104 P1-1, all three measured 2026-08-07):
//
//   1. TRUNCATION. An eight-founder payload is 9,376 characters and callLLM caps user content at
//      8,000 — so the prompt arrived as JSON cut mid-object. Every request, silently.
//   2. TOKENS. Eight tales at 120-180 words each need ~2,500 completion tokens. The free tier meters
//      6k per MINUTE and counts the REQUESTED size, so one founding reserved the whole minute and
//      starved every other call in it.
//   3. IT FED A UI THAT SHOWS ONE. main.js renders story.tale inside a single farmer's sheet — the
//      cast is never displayed together. We were generating eight biographies to satisfy a view
//      that displays one, most of which a player never opens.
//
// One farmer per pass: 1,282 characters in (6x under the cap) and 331 completion tokens out,
// measured against real Groq with the DEPLOYED prompt and schema. (Two earlier figures here, 260
// and 302, came from probes using a shortened stand-in prompt — the real one is 1,947 chars.) It cannot truncate, cannot burst, and "one tale per requested seed"
// becomes trivially checkable because there is exactly one.
//
// The procedural draft is already complete and already on screen, so nobody ever waits — the LLM
// upgrade lands later, farmer by farmer, and the budget follows the player's attention instead of
// being spread evenly over seven strangers. `preferSeed` lets an opened sheet jump the queue.
// seed -> when this farmer last failed to produce a usable tale. Long enough that a genuinely bad
// draft stops blocking the cast, short enough that a transient upstream wobble is retried.
